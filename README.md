# **Key System üîë**  
This program requires a **key** to access its features.  

### **How to Get a Key:**  
- Join the Discord server (**link available in the latest release description**).  
- During **BETA**, keys are **free**.  
- After BETA, premium features (OCR & Premium Account Generator) will require a **paid token**, while basic features (API & Basic Account Generator) will remain **free**.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Attempting to bypass the key system may result in a blacklist.**

# **FAQs**  

### **1. What features are coming next?**  
- **Expanded API support** (currently pets, will include enchants, potions, event items, etc.).  
- **New Gamepass Notifications** via Discord webhook (will work externally, no need to keep the program running).  

### **2. When will BETA end?**  
- No fixed date yet. It will exit BETA once the **Account Generator** is stable.  

### **3. How often are updates?**  
- `jajts-tools.py` is updated **only when new features are added**.
